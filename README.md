# JoyHeal-HackeRam
Team Maverick Hackers attempt for HackeRam hackathon.

Our website provides the location to nearby vaccination camps and hospitals along with the availability of specific medical care within the area using Google Cloud Services. It provides the liberty to search from any place without having to face hectic searching where there is a lack of these facilities.We provide a platform where one can donate organs ,blood and receive blood banks .We have also made added a chatbot where people can freely contact us. In regard to the pandemic, masks should be used as part of a comprehensive ‘Do it all!’ approach including physical distancing, avoiding crowded, closed and close-contact settings, good ventilation, cleaning hands, covering sneezes and coughs, and more . So, in the major section of our website, we've used open CV AI and Python to achieve mask detection.
